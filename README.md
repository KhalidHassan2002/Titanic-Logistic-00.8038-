# Titanic Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a Logistic Regression model. The project involves exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of a machine-learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers including features such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived.

## Dependencies
- Python 3. 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)


# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## 1- Data Exploration and Visualization:

Explore and visualize relationships between features in the dataset.

## 2- Visualization:

Visualize some relations between the featured. 

## 3- Modeling:

Implement a logistic regression model to predict people who survived.
